### Project Title

Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used

To answer these questions using Python, you will need to write a Python script. To help guide your work in this project, a template with helper code and comments is provided in a **bikeshare.py** file, and you will do your scripting in there also. You will need the three city dataset files too:

### Dataset

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core **six (6)** columns:

### How to run?

```
$ python bikeshare.py
```
